# Power Scheduler

## Overall

In Power Scheduler page, User can schedule power status of target cloud resources. 

Power Scheduler page offers listing scheduler information, add/update/delete scheduler.

## Prerequisites

User need to define security policy\(IAM\) before setup power scheduler. 

Before creating Power Scheduler modify your existing policy, For detailed process refer to link below.

Upper position resource group changes first, and Lower position goes second.

Detailed status resource group is done by clicking _**Name of Resource Group.**_

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name | Name of Resource Group |
| Resource Type | Type of Resource Group\(Instance, RDS, Autoscaling\) |
| Target List | List of Cloud Resources to be controlled |

Selecting range of times done by click & drag in calendar.

Schedule has two mode.

| Scheduled mode | State | Description | color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Repeated Schedule |  | Repeated by every weeks. Within selected area, Resources are On, Otherwise\(Non selected\) resources became Off. | ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png) |
| One time | ON | Event time for specific date. At the selected area, resources became on.  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2816%29.png) |

## Limitation & Restrictions

Some limitations for power scheduler service are existed, Most of them are inherited from functionality of each cloud providers.

### AWS

Cloud resources which has conditions below can not managed by power scheduler service

* AutoScalingGroup
  * ASG controlled by _**EKS managed group**_
* RDS Instance
  * Instance that member of _**replication**_
  * SQL Server DB using _**Multi-AZ**_
* RDS Aurora Instance
  * Member of _**Aurora global database**_
  * Cluster that using _**parallel query feature**_
* Reference
  * [AWS DB instance limitation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_StopInstance.html#USER_StopInstance.Limitations)

### Google Cloud

Cloud resources has a such a condition that does not support within power scheduler Service 

* Compute Engine
  * Compute Engine resources may **NOT** turn on/off if selected compute engines are instance of **Instance group**.
  * Categorizing **Instance group**'s compute engine and normal compute engine on the view will be available soon.  
* Instance Group

  * Only **Stateless** type in Instance Group is valid to turn on/off in power scheduler service because Google Cloud supports autoscaling on **Stateless** type only in Instance Group.  \(Refer to[ google.compute.instance\_group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups)\)
  * Minimum number of Instance in Instance group is 1 when instance group scales in except certain type \(Unmanaged Instance Group\).
